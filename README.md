# 314Project2--Dijkstra's Shortest Path

This program takes airport codes and a matrix representation of the airport flight path distances to each other and uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path and distance from each airport to each airport. It outputs a matrix representation of these distances and allows the user to enter specific "start" and "end" airports to find the shortest distance and path between them.
